V2V Communication Safety Aware Application:

This project aimed to enhance road safety by implementing advanced features such as overtaking assistance, blind spot detection, and collision avoidance.

Project Overview:

• Overtaking Assistance: The system was designed to assist drivers in making safe overtaking maneuvers by providing real-time information about the road ahead.

• Blind Spot Detection: The system aimed to detect vehicles in the driver's blind spot and provide visual and auditory warnings to prevent potential collisions during lane changes.

• Collision Avoidance: In the event of an impending collision, the system was designed to take autonomous control of the vehicle's speed and direction to avoid accidents.

Technologies and Tools Used:
- STM32F401 Microcontroller: Responsible for interfacing with the vehicle's motor control system.
- Raspberry Pi with Camera Module: Utilized for object detection.
- Ultrasonic Sensors: Installed on the vehicle to detect objects in proximity.
- UART : Employed for inner communication between the Raspberry Pi and STM32F401.
- PWM Signal Generation : Used to control the car's motor speed for overtaking and collision avoidance.
- Bluetooth Module: Enabled remote control of the vehicle's movement via a mobile application.
- WiFi Module: Facilitated communication between vehicles for cooperative safety measures.
